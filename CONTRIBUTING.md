## Getting Started

If you're new to contributing to open-source projects or our project specifically, here are some steps to get started:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b your-branch-name`).
4. Make your desired changes and ensure they adhere to our coding standards and guidelines.
5. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository (`git push origin your-branch-name`).
7. Open a pull request (PR) against the main repository's `main` branch.

## Code Style and Standards

To maintain consistency and readability across the codebase, we follow certain coding standards and style guidelines. Here are some general principles:

-   Use 3-4 level depth of headings in the markdown files.
-   Make sure to add captions to images, and tables.
-   If image is outsourced, then make sure to add the source of the image either in the image caption or in the reference tab.
-   To write equation in the sentence use 'MathJax' and to write equation in a separate line use 'KaTeX'.
-   Any new equation written using 'KaTex' should have a equation number.
-   If writing code for demonstration, then make sure to use ONE single library (either use qiskit or pennylane or cirq) to demonstrate the topic.
-   Use the `mkdocs` markdown syntax for writing the documentation.

## Code Review Process

All contributions go through a code review process to ensure the quality and integrity of the codebase. Here's what to expect:

1. Once you've submitted a pull request (PR), our team will review your changes.
2. We may provide feedback, suggestions, or requests for changes.
3. You can address the feedback by making additional commits to your branch.
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main repository.
